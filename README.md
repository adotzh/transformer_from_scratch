# Implement a Transformer from Scratch using JAX

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Transformer model from scratch using JAX. The Transformer model, introduced in the paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al., has revolutionized the field of natural language processing.
